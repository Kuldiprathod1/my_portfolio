	<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a guru or prabhu.[28] The education was delivered through Gurukula. The relationship between Guru and Shishya was very important part of the education.[29] Takshasila (in modern-day Pakistan) was the earliest recorded centre of higher learning in India from possibly 8th century BCE, and it is debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not in modern sense, since teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in a Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India.
